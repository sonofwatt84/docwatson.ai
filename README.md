This is collection of code samples by me, Peter Watson.  A quick summary:
- It's mostly in R with some Python
- Applications for: 
  - spatial data processing 
  - weather data processing
  - ML model crossvalidation  
  - Model tuning with MPI
  - Model ouput dashboards and visualizations

All scripts come with example data.  Though some scripts may depend on data that can be downloaded with some of the included utilities.
