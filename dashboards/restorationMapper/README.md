# Damage, Work, and Restoration Time App

This is a dashboard for visualizing predicted damages from an impact model, and provides an interface for estimating restoration times based on various allocations of service crews, and the estimated amount of work associated with weather-related damages.  I did a POC backend in 2020, and it worked pretty well. We're in the process of scaling this system up for a larger territory.
