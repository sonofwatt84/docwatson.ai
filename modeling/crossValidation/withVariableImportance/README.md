This is like the basic leave-one-group-out (LOGO) cross-validation, but it also generates quick/dirty relative variable importance metrics for each model trained.

This version of the script also introduces random noise variables, which can be used to measure the relative importance of the predictor variables.  This is useful for variable selection.  A method like Boruta variable selection is similar, but more rigorous and more powerful.  This less powerful approach has some advantages because it usually encourages a more aggressive downselection criteria and is better at remove more variables (which is desirable sometimes)
