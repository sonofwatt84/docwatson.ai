# Optimization with Differential Evolution

This is a script for optimizing hyperparameters of an ML model using Differential Evolution, and optimized with MPI.

Differential Evolution is pretty computationally expensive, but it's robust to local minimums, and doesn't require much adjustment or tuning so it's particularly well suited for ML hyperparameter searches.
