This script downloads RTMA data from various sources.

ndgdDownloader.py downloads from the NCEI National Digital Guidance Database.  But recently the quality and organization of this archive has suffered.  RTMA data is also hosted by several cloud services, so there are better alternatives.

eeDownloader.py downloads the data from Google Earth Engine.
