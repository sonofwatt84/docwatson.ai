# Spatial Processing

Working and programming with GIS datasets requires familiarity with a variety of topics and libraries.  While many tasks can be performed manually with desktop applications like QGIS, coding processes is usually the best way to effectively process spatial data at scale.  I've included a few examples in Python here, but I actually prefer working with spatial data in R: the libraries work well together, it's high level enough to code fast, but powerful enough to do everything you need to.
