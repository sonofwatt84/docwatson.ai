# Line Length Measurement

This script measures the length of a spatial polyline, distributed across a range of sub-regions, such that it outputs the length of the line in each sub-region. This has applications in measuring the amount of networked infrastructure in different areas like towns and counties.

This example measures the length of roads in the cells of an arbirary grid and exports a ESRI Shapefile with the lengths added a new field.
